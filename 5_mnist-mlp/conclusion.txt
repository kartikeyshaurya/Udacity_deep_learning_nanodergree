Task List:

Increase (or decrease) the number of nodes in each of the hidden layers. Do you notice evidence of overfitting (or underfitting)?

increases the number of epochs to 50 and hence accuracy increase 98.13 %
decrease the number of epochs to 10 and hence accuracy increases 98.11 %
 
 
 
 

Increase (or decrease) the number of hidden layers. Do you notice evidence of overfitting (or underfitting)?
there is no changes in the accuracy same as 98.11 %
 
Remove the dropout layers in the network. Do you notice evidence of overfitting?
nope no changes
 
Remove the ReLU activation functions. Does the test accuracy decrease?
nope 
 
Remove the image pre-processing step with dividing every pixel by 255. Does the accuracy decrease?
yes the accuracy decrease by the 4  % 


  
Try a different optimizer, such as stochastic gradient descent.

  
  
  
Increase (or decrease) the batch size.
the accuracy decrease by 1.5 %
